CapsLocKeys.ahk
-------------------------------

## What's this?
An autohotkey's script which makes your capslock more powerful by adding many hot keys on it.

## Features
* Capslock : ESC
* shift+Capslock : Capslock
* Capslock+h/j/k/l : Left/Down/Up/Right arrow
* Cpaslock+u : backspace
* Capslock+d : DEL
* Capslock+a : HOME
* Capslock+e : END
* Capslock+o : open a new line but don't break this line into two line on the cursor

## Killing feature
### Number line lock -- for programmers
When you press Capslock+TAB, it will enter the `mark state`. Then when you press the number keys above the alphanumeric keys, it will enter the marks on the button rather than the numbers itself, just like press shift+numbers in normal. If you want to enter numbers, press `shift+numbers button` instead. Press Capslock+TAB again will exit `mark state`.

We also have two icons which show the state of it. It will replace the tray icon of the autohotkey.
